# Tutorial Video Recording Guide

This guide helps you create professional tutorial videos for the Rust Video Editor using the scripts provided.

## Pre-Recording Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation
- **Clean Desktop**: Remove unnecessary icons and notifications
- **Resolution**: Set to 1920x1080 for consistency
- **Multiple Monitors**: Record on primary monitor only
- **Theme**: Use a clean, professional theme (light or dark based on preference)

### 2. Software Setup
```bash
# Recording Software Recommendations
- OBS Studio (free, cross-platform)
- Camtasia (paid, good for editing)
- ScreenFlow (macOS)

# Key Recording Settings
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Frame Rate: 60fps (for smooth cursor movement)
- Bitrate: 10-15 Mbps
- Audio: 48kHz, -12dB to -6dB levels
```

### 3. Project Preparation
Create a dedicated tutorial workspace:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/RustVideoEditor-Tutorials/{projects,media,exports}
cd ~/RustVideoEditor-Tutorials

# Download sample media pack
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tutorial-media-pack media/
```

### 4. Sample Media Organization
```
media/
â”œâ”€â”€ video/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ talking-head-01.mp4 (30s, 1080p)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ talking-head-02.mp4 (45s, 1080p)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ broll-nature-01.mp4 (60s, 4K)

```

## Recording Best Practices

### 1. Audio Recording

**Microphone Setup**:
- Use a quality USB microphone (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica AT2020)
- Position 6-8 inches from mouth
- Use pop filter to reduce plosives
- Record in quiet environment

**Voice Guidelines**:
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Pause briefly after important points
- Re-record mistakes rather than editing
- Maintain consistent energy throughout

### 2. Screen Recording

**Mouse and Keyboard**:
- Move mouse smoothly and deliberately
- Pause on buttons before clicking
- Use keyboard shortcuts but announce them
- Highlight cursor if your software supports it

**Visual Cues**:
- Zoom in on small UI elements
- Use annotations for emphasis
- Add keystroke callouts
- Include progress indicators

### 3. Pacing and Flow

**Timing Guidelines**:
- Introduction: 10-15 seconds
- Each major section: 1-2 minutes
- Transitions between sections: 3-5 seconds
- Conclusion: 15-20 seconds

**Content Density**:
- One concept per section
- Show, then explain
- Repeat important shortcuts
- Summarize at section ends

## Recording Workflow

### 1. Pre-Recording Checklist
- [ ] Rust Video Editor updated to latest version
- [ ] Sample media files prepared
- [ ] Script reviewed and rehearsed
- [ ] Recording software configured
- [ ] Microphone tested
- [ ] Desktop cleaned
- [ ] Notifications disabled

### 2. Recording Process

**Take System**:
```
Tutorial-01-Installation-Take-01.mp4
Tutorial-01-Installation-Take-02.mp4
Tutorial-01-Installation-FINAL.mp4
```

**Section Recording**:
1. Record introduction separately
2. Record each major section as separate take
3. Record conclusion separately
4. Allows for easier re-recording of mistakes

### 3. Common Issues and Solutions

**Performance Issues**:
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use proxy recording if needed
- Lower preview quality during recording
- Pre-render complex effects

**Audio Problems**:
- Normalize audio to -12dB
- Remove background noise in post
- Use consistent microphone position
- Record room tone for noise reduction

## Post-Production

### 1. Editing Your Tutorial

**Basic Editing Workflow**:
1. Import all takes into Rust Video Editor
2. Create rough cut following script
3. Add title cards and lower thirds
4. Insert zoom effects for UI elements
5. Add background music (-20dB to -25dB)
6. Color correct for consistency

### 2. Graphics and Annotations

**Essential Graphics**:
```
- Intro animation (3-5 seconds)
- Section title cards
- Keyboard shortcut callouts
- Arrow/highlight annotations
- Outro with links/subscribe
```

**Brand Consistency**:
- Use consistent fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
- Maintain color scheme throughout
- Position elements consistently
- Include logo watermark (subtle)

### 3. Export Settings

**YouTube Upload**:
```yaml
Format: MP4
Codec: H.264 (High Profile)
